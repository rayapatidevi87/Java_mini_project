Open the project in Android Studio.

Configure Firebase:

Create or open your Firebase project. Add the Android application with package name com.example.safeher. Place google-services.json inside the app/ folder. Enable Firebase Authentication and Realtime Database. Sync the project with Gradle files.

Connect an Android device or start an emulator.

Click Run in Android Studio.

## Output
The application displays a welcome screen and dashboard with SOS alerts, trusted contacts, location sharing, nearby safe places, and SOS history. Users can prepare emergency SMS messages and share their location with trusted contacts.

## Note
SOS messages open the phone's SMS application and require the user to press Send. Location sharing uses the last-known available location and may not always represent the current location. Safe Places uses Google Maps search to find nearby facilities. SOS history records the alert initiation process; it does not confirm SMS delivery. Firebase security rules must be properly configured before production use.
